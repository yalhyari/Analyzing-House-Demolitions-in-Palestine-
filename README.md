# Analyzing-House-Demolitions-in-Palestine-
This is a simple project for an introductory data science course. It analyzes data related to forced house demolitions in Palestine from 2004 to 2021, aiming to understand the impact of these demolitions on local communities. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes information on demolition orders, displaced residents, reasons for demolitions, and geographical distribution. It utilizes simple statistical methods and data visualization techniques (R, ggplot2) to explore trends and impacts of house demolitions over time.
